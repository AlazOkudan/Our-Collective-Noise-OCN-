## Overview

**Our Collective Noise (OCN) v3.2** is a research-based tactical media project that transforms top-down surveillance technologies into a bottom-up tactical tool. As an offline system, OCN uses live webcam feeds, machine learning (ML), and computer vision (CV) to detect people and simultaneously converts them into coarse pixels‚Äîreplacing the common aim of precise identification in surveillance technologies with anonymity.

The project explores concepts of **noise**, **de-identification**, **accidental aesthetics**, and **human-machine collaboration**. Coarse pixels are constantly stitched together to create collective abstract human-machine interaction patterns that people are collectively and unidentifiably part of. In a world where thriving ML, CV, and AI technologies increasingly rely on cleaner datasets, higher processing capacities, and precise labels, OCN turns the technology against itself in pursuit of revealing the latent potential in noise, anonymity, and collective action.

**Abstract**: *Our Collective Noise (OCN) is a research-based tactical media project. As an attempt to transform the top-down pervasive qualities of machine learning (ML), computer vision (CV), and surveillance technologies into a bottom-up tactical tool, it plays around the concepts of noise, de-identification, accidental aesthetics, and human-machine collaboration. OCN, as an offline system, uses live webcam feed, ML, and CV to detect people and simultaneously turn them into coarse pixels to replace the common aim of precise identification in surveillance technologies with anonymity. Coarse pixels are constantly stitched together to create collective abstract human-machine interaction patterns that people are collectively and unidentifiably part of. In a world where thriving ML, CV, and AI (artificial intelligence) technologies increasingly rely on cleaner datasets, higher processing capacities, precise labels and categories, OCN turns the technology against itself, in pursuit of revealing the latent potential in noise, anonymity, and collective action.*

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- YOLO dependencies

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlazOkudan/Our-Collective-Noise-OCN-.git
   cd Our-Collective-Noise-OCN-
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download required YOLO files**
   
   Download these files and place them in your project directory:
   
   | File | Description | Download Link |
   |------|-------------|---------------|
   | `yolov3.weights` | Pre-trained YOLO weights | [Download (248MB)](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights) |
   | `yolov3.cfg` | YOLO configuration | [Download](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg) |
   | `coco.names` | COCO class names | [Download](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names) |

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python "OCN v.3.2_Published.py"
   ```

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. Connect your webcam
2. Run the application: `python "OCN v.3.2_Published.py"`
3. The application will open showing your webcam feed and an empty collage grid
4. Press `R` to start recording detected persons to the collage
5. Detected individuals will automatically be added to the grid with pixelation effects

### Keyboard Controls

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| `R` | Toggle person recording to collage |
| `V` | Start/stop combined video recording |
| `Y` | Start/stop webcam-only video recording |
| `P` | Toggle pixelation on/off |
| `+/-` | Increase/decrease pixelation intensity |
| `W/S` | Increase/decrease grid rows |
| `A/D` | Decrease/increase grid columns |
| `O` | Toggle color/black & white mode |
| `K` | Toggle contrast enhancement |
| `[/]` | Decrease/increase contrast level |
| `L` | Switch between vertical/horizontal layout |
| `B` | Toggle collage background (black/white) |
| `T` | Toggle random/linear placement mode |
| `F` | Toggle fullscreen |
| `X` | Reset current collage |
| `C` | Choose save directory |
| `Esc` | Exit application |

### How It Works

OCN operates as a **tactical reversal** of surveillance technology:

1. **Detection Without Identification**: YOLOv3 detects human presence but immediately obscures identity through coarse pixelation
2. **Noise as Resistance**: Instead of pursuing cleaner data, OCN embraces and amplifies noise as a form of technological resistance  
3. **Collective Pattern Creation**: Individual pixelated forms are stitched into collective abstract patterns where people become unidentifiably part of a larger whole
4. **Human-Machine Collaboration**: Users actively participate in the creation process through real-time controls, making each session a unique collaborative artwork
5. **Accidental Aesthetics**: The system celebrates imperfection, glitches, and unintended visual outcomes as meaningful creative elements

### Conceptual Framework

**Noise vs. Signal**: OCN deliberately introduces noise where surveillance systems seek signal clarity, using technological "failure" as a creative and political strategy.

**De-identification**: Rather than improving recognition accuracy, OCN purposefully degrades visual information to protect individual privacy while maintaining collective presence.

**Bottom-up Reclamation**: The project transforms top-down surveillance tools into bottom-up instruments for collective expression and anonymity.

## Output Files

- **Collage Images**: Saved as `collage_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg` in the `detected_persons/` folder
- **Combined Videos**: Saved as `recording_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.avi` in the `video_recordings/` folder
- **Webcam Videos**: Saved as `webcam_recording_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.avi` in the `video_recordings/` folder

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **"yolov3.weights not found"**: Download the weights file from the link above
- **Low detection accuracy**: Ensure good lighting and clear camera view
